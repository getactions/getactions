This workflow is designed to automate the process of code testing and formatting checks in order to maintain code quality and enforce development standards. It is triggered when there is either a push or a pull request to the `main` branch and includes steps to set up [Deno](https://deno.com/), ensure code formatting consistency, lint the code, and run tests.
